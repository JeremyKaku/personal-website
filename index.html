        <p>
            As a former solution-oriented software engineer, student of MS of Computer Science at Northeastern
            University,
            lifelong learner, and adventurer, I
            bring a wealth of professional
            experience in software development spanning diverse industries. I’m passionate about software development
            and I’m looking forward to getting to work on new projects in the near future. I enjoy development because
            of the satisfaction I get by overcoming challenges. I am motivated by the opportunity that software provides
            to positively impact the life of an individual, and the world as a whole.
